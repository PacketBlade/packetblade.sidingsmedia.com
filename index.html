				<h2>What is <strong>Packet Blade</strong>?</h2>
				<p>
                    Packet Blade is a low cost, open source router
                    designed for high density and low power
                    applications. It is based upon the Radxa CM3 and
                    utilizes the PCI-e bus to allow any PCI-e card to be installed.

				<p>
                    Packet Blade is aimed at all those who want to learn
				    about large scale routing deployments or are looking for
				    a low power, low cost routing solution.

                    We aim to have a mostly functioning device by
                    mid-January 2023. A more detailed roadmap can be
                    found on <a

				<h2>Is it <strong>open source</strong>?</h2>
				<p>
                    Yes! Packet blade is entirely open source.
                    Everything from the hardware designs to the software
                    and even this website are fully open source under
                    various licences including creative commons, MIT and
                    the CERN open hardware licence.
